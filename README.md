# Testing Toolbox!

> Companion repo for [this](https://unixmagick.xyz/testing-convenience/) and [this](https://unixmagick.xyz/testing-isolation/) entry on my [blog](https://unixmagick.xyz/).

This repo contains some simple, practical examples of the concepts covered in the above-mentioned posts:

- Fixture
- Builder
- ObjectMother
- Dummy
- Fake
- Stub
- Spy
- Mock

The `master` branch only contains boilerplate.

You'll find the examples in the accordingly named branches!

## Note

Please keep in mind that these are just simple examples of useful testing tools.

Concrete implementations are not to be taken seriously and the '*production code*' in this repo is kinda silly to say the least ;-).
